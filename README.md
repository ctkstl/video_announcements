# Christ the King School Video Announcements

The materials used for producing the video announcements.

The YouTube channel we are using for announcements is unlisted, please do not post a link to it or its streaming key in this repository!



## Setup
There are two software components that are needed to produce the live videos. 

*   [Open Broadcast Software](https://obsproject.com/) - This is use for controlling the scene, encoding the video, and uploading it to youtube. 
*   [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - This is a general drawing program, we will be using it for creating graphics that will be displayed in the video, or overlaid on live video.

###Additional software

*   [avidemux](http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/) - This is a simple program for editing offline video. I.E. if there is pre-recorded video that will be played during a live stream, but it needs to be edited first.
*   [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - This is primairly for creating 3-D models, but since these are often used in video, it has a built in video editor.
*   [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) - This is an audio editor, if there is ever stand-alone audio that needs to be edited.
